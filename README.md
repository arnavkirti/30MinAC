## 30MinAC - A CLI tool for DSA

This is a python script that is a Leetcode tracker: 

1. When you run the script it gives you 30 min timer to solve the question. 
2. Then after 30 mins a hint is provided.
3. After that it gives you 10 more mins to solve it. 
4. If submission is not detected then, it just alerts you to stop wasting time and just 


The script starts when user inputs the problem url. 
Then 30 mins.
Then hint.
Then 10 mins.
Then alerts to see solution.


Point system: 
Solved within 30 mins: 10 points.
Solved with hints. (within 40 mins): 5 points
Couldn't solve on own: 0 points

Checking Mechanism: 
1. Manual: I ask 
2. Semi-Automatic

What needs to be done:
- Hint implementation - i need to clean the output.
- Submission Checker - implement submission checker that checks submission
- Add a Leaderboard functionality - that saves the points to a Leaderboard
